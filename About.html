                        Hi! i am Ridwan, a passionate Fronted developer. 
                        Over the years, I've crafted my skills in User Interface Engineering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe in the power of simplicity and usability. Every line of code, every design decision 
                        should serve the user first.

                        Joining the Hng Intern program is a significant step in my journey. Here's what I hope to achieve:

                            <strong>Master Modern Frontend Technologies:</strong> 
                            I want to go beyond the basics and truly understand React, TypeScript, and modern build tools. 
                            Not just how to use them, but why they exist and when to apply them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Build Production-Ready Applications:</strong> 
                            I aim to create applications that aren't just functional, but performant, accessible, and 
                            maintainable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Develop a Strong Problem-Solving Mindset:</strong> 
                            I want to approach challenges systematically, break down complex problems, and find elegant 
                            solutions. This program will help me think like a senior developer.

                    <p>
                        Growth comes from acknowledging our weaknesses. Here are the areas where I'm still building confidence:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="confidence-list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>JavaScript Advanced Concepts:</strong> 
                            Topics like closures, prototypal inheritance, and asynchronous patterns still trip me up sometimes. 
                            I understand them conceptually, but applying them in real-world scenarios needs more practice.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>State Management:</strong> 
                            While I can manage local component state, working with global state management solutions like 
                            Redux or Zustand feels overwhelming. Knowing when to lift state up versus when to use context 
                            or external libraries is still unclear.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Testing:</strong> 
                            I know testing is crucial, but writing meaningful unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests 
                            feels intimidating. I often skip tests because I'm not sure what to test or how to structure them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> 
                            Understanding concepts like memoization, code splitting, and lazy loading is one thing, but 
                            knowing when and how to apply them to actual applications is where I struggle.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Backend Integration:</strong> 
                            Working with APIs, handling authentication, managing server state, and dealing with edge cases 
                            like loading states and errors still challenges me. I need more hands-on experience here.

                        If you're reading this, it means you've come a long way. Remember when you first started this program? 
                        The excitement mixed with anxiety?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I hope by now you've realized that everyone starts somewhere. Those developers you admired didn't 
                        become experts overnight. They struggled, made mistakes, debugged for hours, and questioned themselves 
                        too. The difference? They kept going.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Remember why you started this journey: to create beautiful, accessible experiences that make people's 
                        lives easier. Never lose sight of that.

                    <p>
                        Frontend development isn't just about making things look pretty (though that's part of it!). 
                        It's about creating the bridge between human and machine. Every button, every animation, every 
                        interaction - they're all opportunities to make someone's day a little bit easier, a little bit better.
